# ðŸ§—â™‚ Crafting Your Project Roadmap

In short, here's what we'll do:

* [x] Schedule your time to complete projects in the cohort deadlines,
* [x] Execute **two core projects** for your CV/portfolio,
* [x] Complete an **optional third project,**
* [x] Turn **qualifiable tech projects** to PRDs or other PM project types,
* [x] Get feedback from peers and the HOP team
* [x] Compile projects and start working on the rest of your CV.

Instead of rushing things, we suggest you to complete projects by dedicating just a few hours over the next 3-5 weeks. **But why?**

* Produces higher quality work
* Iteration based on feedback
* Reduces stress and builds discipline

**And no, you WON'T need to do this:**
