   * [x] Through additional features, revisions or shift in \[GTM] strategy.
   * [x] Research user needs, define requirements, and craft a plan of action, and
   * [x] Outline the value proposition and business impact.

Your first project idea is live at the page below:

2. **Product Critique (4-7 days)**
