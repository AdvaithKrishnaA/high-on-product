## Defining a Problem

> ### “If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”
>
> \- Albert Einstein

#### What is a Problem statement?

* It is a simple but great way to concentrate on the key problem(s) to solve, constantly asking the ‘why’ of a specific problem or need.
* It is NOT a solution in disguise.
* It needs to reflect your understanding of the problem that you’re looking to solve and serve as a communication tool in ensuring that other people are on the same page with regards to the understanding of a problem.

#### What goes inside defining a problem statement?

1. Do background research on the:
   * Product
   * Company
   * Market
2. Understand the Customer:
   * Build a persona
   * Map their journey
   * Identify their pain points
3. Define the problem you want to solve
4. Analyze the impact of the problem
5. Identify the root cause of the problem
6. Prepare the problem statement

## Understanding the User

## Metrics for Product Management

Metrics are CRUCIAL for understanding your users and whether your product is delivering value. Numbers tell a story. And you need to speak that language.

First, let's understand the difference between Metrics, KPIs, and OKRs. Take a look at this article:

#### Some Commonly Used Metrics

* Quantitative (numbers-focused): MAU, conversion rate, revenue
* Qualitative (user feedback): NPS, satisfaction scores, interviews
* Leading (predictive): New sign-ups, quality of inbound leads
* Lagging (historical): Revenue, churn rate
* Business: Revenue, profit margins, acquisition costs
* Product: Adoption, retention, feature usage

#### Selecting your Metrics

The AARRR framework is a model for tracking and optimizing the customer journey. It categorizes metrics into the following stages:

* Acquisition/Awareness - How do you acquire new users?
* Activation - Do users have a great first experience?
* Retention - How often do users come back?
* Referral - How do you incentivize sharing?
* Revenue - How do you monetize users?
