### What are aptitude tests in PM assessments?

Aptitude tests are conducted by almost all companies, irrespective of role, to test candidates' logical skills. The major topics covered under these tests are logical reasoning, quantitative aptitude, data interpretation, and verbal ability.

### How should I prepare?

1. **Groundwork:** Reach out to seniors who have gone through the process before to gather insights, questions, test patterns, and valuable tips. Collect resources and mock tests for practice.&#x20;
2. **Practice:** Focus on practicing and improving key topics within each section of aptitude tests, as there is a standard set of topics that can be mastered over time.
3. **Mock Tests:** Take timed mock tests regularly to improve speed and accuracy. Document new concepts and strategies for reference.
