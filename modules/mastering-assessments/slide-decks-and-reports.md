# ðŸ–¼ Slide Decks and Reports

### What do companies look for in PM decks?

* [x] Has the candidate found an actual problem?
* [x] Has the candidate understood the problem statement and the companyâ€™s products well?
* [x] Does the candidate have a deep customer understanding?
* [x] Does the solution address the root cause of the problem, not just the surface symptoms?
* [x] How does solution & the product design satisfy all the stakeholders?
* [x] Is the presentation focused or does it go off on tangents?
* [x] Were tradeoffs evaluated and priorities assessed when listing down solutions?

### Some General Tips

* [x] Make sure each slide and its content have an overall purpose. Each slide must convey a set of key takeaways for the person reading it.
* [x] Focus on conveying the most important information visually through charts, graphs, and diagrams rather than dense text.
* [x] Your solutions donâ€™t necessarily have to be very fancy always, good ideas are generally simple and improvements to existing products.
* [x] Limit the number of slides to keep it concise and impactful.
* [x] If possible, include an executive summary with key takeaways and recommendations.
* [x] Don't overcomplicate the design. Maintain a consistent, clean visual style.
* [x] Use consistent formatting, fonts, color palette throughout. Use color palettes according to the company's branding guidelines or use soothing colors (if hypothetical).
* [x] Triple check for perfect grammar, spelling, and formatting. Sloppiness reflects poorly.
* [x] Prioritize slides that demonstrate user research insights, market analysis, competitive assessment.
* [x] Keep enough labelling and arrows for ease of understanding, especially when making wireframes. Ensure charts/graphs have clear legends and axis labels.
