### Why SQL for PM assessments?

It's not just about data; itâ€™s about making informed decisions, understanding customer needs better, and driving your projects with real insights.&#x20;

Plus, it's an underrated but essential skill that can set you apart in the product world. Do check out this blog if you're interested to know more:

### What SQL topics should I cover while preparing for PM assessments?

Here are the topics to cover that will equip you well for the assessments:

1. **SQL Basics**
   * Start with a SQL-based RDBMS like MySQL
   * How to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   * Understanding basic SQL syntax, clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY.
2. **Joins and Subqueries**
   * Using JOIN operations to merge rows from two or more tables
   * Writing subqueries to perform nested queries
3. **Aggregate Functions** (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
4. **Date and Time Functions**
5. **Data Manipulation and Cleaning**
   * Data type conversions and handling nulls
   * String functions for cleaning and manipulating textual data
6. **Window Functions**
7. **Basics of Regular Expressions (REGEX)**

### How to get started?

1. You can refer to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) to learn key SQL concepts. Alternatively, you can refer to **individual topics** from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses-all?number=1\&technology=SQL) (this takes a lot more time, so beware!)

2. Start exploring databases on your PC using an IDE or online SQL editors. You can try Programiz's editor at [this link](https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/).

3. Start solving problems from either [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/databases/sql-queries) (more relevant) or HackerRank in parallel.
4. Once you finish the basics, complete the [SQL50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) set from LeetCode to strengthen your learning.

### What Next?

1. Get your hands on previous year's questions, and find new or random problems to solve every day.
2. Reattempt the harder questions from the sets, and verify that itâ€™s easier for you the second time.&#x20;
3. If you still have a lot of time left, find a friend who shares the same vision and challenge each other with new questions every now and then. Start preparing for interviews.
