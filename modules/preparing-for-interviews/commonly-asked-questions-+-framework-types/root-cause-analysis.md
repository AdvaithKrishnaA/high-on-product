# ðŸ“Œ Root Cause Analysis

### Goal of this Framework

* Demonstrates your ability to critically analyze problems
* Identify underlying causes and develop effective solutions
* During a project's life cycle, various issues or challenges may arise, and the interviewer wants to assess your problem-solving skills and how you approach these situations.

### How-Tos for Tackling RCA problems in PM Interviews

* Start by collecting information about the problemâ€™s nature and its extent
* Formulate hypotheses on potential causes. Consider both internal and external factors.
* Sometimes, based on the problem's nature, the interviewer may prompt you to start with a conversion funnel (e.g. when number of active users have dropped for a product)
* Once your hypothesis is proven right, narrow down to a root cause (ask additional questions if needed).
* Finally, suggest some solutions (new features, improvements, etc.)&#x20;
