# 4️⃣ Converting an Existing Software Project into a PM Project

A general rule of thumb is you can take a 2:1 ratio in PM CVs, i.e. for every two software projects, you should have one solid PM project.

But let's say you don't have any PM projects yet. In that case, one of our tech/software projects could potentially be restructured into a comprehensive product management project.

When doing this, here are a few key things to keep in mind (assuming you go for a PRD) :

* Shift the focus from just technical requirements to the overall vision, goals, and user needs.
* Expand sections on target audience, use cases, product positioning.
* Make sure to cover the business case - market analysis, revenue models, etc.
* Try to document the full product lifecycle - roadmap, release plan, evaluation, and success metrics.
* \[Optional] You can briefly mention product messaging, branding, and go-to-market strategy.

The core technical specs can carry over, but you'll want to reframe a bunch of it through a PM lens.

Take it step-by-step, ensuring each section tells a cohesive product story.
