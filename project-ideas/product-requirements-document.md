# 3️⃣ Product Requirements Document

### Why PRD?

* A PRD captures the **vision, goals, target audience, key features, and functionality** of the product.
* By defining the product's features and requirements, a PRD allows you to **estimate the effort, resources, and timeline** required for development.
* A PRD establishes the boundaries of the **product's scope** (again, a good product is a well-defined one!)
* And of course, a PRD serves as the **single source of truth** for anyone involved in product development and execution.

### Problem Statement
