<summary>#001: Craft a user journey map ðŸ“Š detailing the payments feature within the PayTM app.</summary>

Feel free to utilize tools such as FigJam or Whimsical for this endeavor (Tutorials available on YouTube). Some pointers for you to follow:

1. Be user-first. Imagining you're in the user's shoes (or chappal, depending on the user) helps.
2. Don't hesitate to flex your presentation skills (Hint: emojis make boring texts like these fun :wink:)
