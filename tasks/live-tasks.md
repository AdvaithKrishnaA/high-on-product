### Craft a user journey map ðŸ“Š detailing the payments feature within the PayTM app.

Feel free to utilize tools such as FigJam or Whimsical for this endeavor (Tutorials available on YouTube). Some pointers for you to follow:

1. Be user-first. Imagining you're in the user's shoes (or chappal, depending on the user) helps.
2. Don't hesitate to flex your presentation skills (Hint: emojis make boring texts like these fun :wink:)
