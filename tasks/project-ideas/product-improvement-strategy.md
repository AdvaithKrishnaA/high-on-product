# 1⃣ Product Improvement/Strategy

The first project is a case study on **Evernote**. Those who haven’t done a case study before, don’t worry - go through the resources at&#x20;

We'll also provide references and blogs to help you along the way 🤟🏻.&#x20;

Those who have done one before, we'd encourage you to also work on this as it will sharpen your product skills (and an extra achievement doesn't hurt 💪🏻).

Let's solve the latest PM School challenge (available at [https://pmschool.io/ChallengeDetails/live/65bd314810f7c756fbda9c5e](https://pmschool.io/ChallengeDetails/live/65bd314810f7c756fbda9c5e)).&#x20;

Go through the problem statement, and if you have any doubt in understanding the problem statement or need help in solving it, discussions are always open in **HOP Talks** :herb:. **Need inspiration?** Refer to [how-tos-to-get-started.md](../../modules/building-your-profile/how-tos-to-get-started.md "mention")

We will provide the link to submit your assignment to us so that we can give you some feedback. **Make sure you submit your work on PM School's page too!**
